    <h3 class="book-author">Sir Arthur Conan Doyle</h3>
    <p class="book-intro"><b>The Hound of the Baskervilles</b> is the third of the crime novels written by Sir Arthur
        Conan
        Doyle featuring the detective Sherlock Holmes. Originally serialised in <i>The Strand Magazine</i> from August
        1901 to
        April 1902, it is set largely on Dartmoor in Devon in England's West Country and tells the story of an attempted
        murder inspired by the legend of a fearsome, diabolical hound of supernatural origin. Sherlock Holmes and his
        companion <abbr title="Doctor">Dr.</abbr> Watson investigate the case.</p>

            There's a pretty good case to be made that this is Holmes at his finest; in any case, it's a great
            introduction to the master detective and his faithful chronicler. The plot moves along at a good pace, the
            quality of the writing is excellent (even if Watson and Doyle are a bit wordy by today's standards), and
            none of the potential pitfalls that crop up elsewhere in the canon and might require parental intervention,
            from Mormon-bashing to drug use, is in evidence here. Holmes and Watson are well portrayed and have some
            classic, character-defining interactions.
